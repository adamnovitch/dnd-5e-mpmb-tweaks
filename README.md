### Revised Mystic

As we all know, the Mystic class is super broken, but I believe it can be fixed
with one major fix and a few minor ones.

#### Changes
- Psi Point progression resembles the spell progression of a Ranger or Paladin,
with the exception of having 2 psi points at level 1.
- Mystical recovery is only usable once per short or long rest
- Strength of Mind recovers during a long rest only
- Any abilities gained from a Discipline end when you end focus on that Discipline.

#### Todo
- Potent Psionics
- Psionic Mastery
- Psionic Body
