Psi Points
You have an internal reservoir of energy that is represented by psi points. Each psionic discipline describes effects you can create with it by spending a certain number of psi points. A psionic talent requires no psi points. The number of psi points you have is based on your mystic level, as shown in the Psi Points column of the Mystic table. The number shown for your level is your psi point maximum. Your psi point total returns to its maximum when you finish a long rest. The number of psi points you have can't go below 0 or over your maximum.

Psi Limit
There is a limit on the number of psi points you can spend to activate a psionic discipline. The limit is based on your mystic level, as shown in the Psi Limit column of the Mystic table.

Psychic Focus
As a bonus action, you can choose one of your psionic disciplines and gain its psychic focus benefit. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another bonus action to choose a different focus benefit. You can have only one psychic focus benefit at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn't limit your ability to use other disciplines.

Psionic Ability
Intelligence is your psionic ability for your psionic disciplines. You use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psionic discipline or when making an attack roll with one.

Discipline save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Discipline attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Mystic Order
At 1st level, you choose a Mystic Order. Your order gives you features when you choose it at 1st level and additional features at 3rd, 6th, and 14th level.

Order of the Avatar (Avatar Disciplines)
Order of the Awakened (Awakened Disciplines)
Order of the Immortal (Immortal Disciplines)
Order of the Nomad (Nomad Disciplines)
Order of the Soul Knife
Order of the Wu Jen (Wu Jen Disciplines)
Mystical Recovery
Starting at 2nd level, immediately after you spend psi points on a psionic discipline, you can take a bonus action to regain hit points equal to the number of psi points you spent.

Telepathy
At 2nd level, you can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 120 feet of you in this manner. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic messages, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language or be telepathic itself.

Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Strength of Mind
Starting at 4th level, you can replace your proficiency in Wisdom saving throws whenever you finish a short or long rest. To do so, choose Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, or Charisma. You gain proficiency in saves using that ability, instead of Wisdom. This change lasts until you finish your next short or long rest.

Potent Psionics
At 8th level, once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon, you can deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage to that target. When you reach 14th level, this extra damage increases to 2d8. In addition, you add your Intelligence modifier to any damage roll you make for a psionic talent.

Consumptive Power
At 10th level, when activating a psionic discipline, you can pay its psi point cost with your hit points, instead of using any psi points. Your current hit points and hit point maximum are both reduced by the number of hit points you spend. This reduction can't be lessened in any way, and the reduction to your hit point maximum lasts until you finish a long rest.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

Psionic Mastery
Beginning at 11th level, as an action, you gain 9 special psi points that you can spend only on disciplines that require an action or a bonus action to use. You can use all 9 points on one discipline, or you can spread them across multiple disciplines. You can't also use normal psi points at the same time you use your special psi points. When you finish a long rest, you lose any of these special points that you haven't spent. If more than one of the disciplines you activate with these points require concentration, you can concentrate on all of them. Activating one of them ends any effect you were already concentrating on, and if you begin concentrating on an effect that doesn't use these special points, the disciplines end that you're concentrating on. At 15th level, the pool of psi points you gain from this feature increases to 11.

You have one use of this feature, and you regain any expended use of it with a long rest. You gain one additional use of this feature at 13th, 15th, and 17th level.

Psionic Body
At 20th level, you gain the following benefits:

You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
You no longer age.
You are immune to disease, poison damage, and the poisoned condition.
If you die, roll a d20. On a 10 or higher, you discorporate with 0 hit points, instead of dying, and you fall unconscious. You and your gear disappear. You appear at a spot of your choice 1d3 days later on the plane of existence where you died, having gained the benefits of one long rest.
Order of the Avatar
Bonus Disciplines
At 1st level, you learn two additional psionic disciplines of your choice. They must be chosen from among the Avatar disciplines.

Armor Training
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with medium armor and shields.

Avatar of Battle
Starting at 3rd level, while you aren't incapacitated, each ally within 30 feet of you who can see you gains a +2 bonus to initiative rolls.

Avatar of Healing
Beginning at 6th level, while you aren't incapacitated, each ally within 30 feet of you who can see you regains additional hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 0) whenever they regain hit points from a psionic discipline.

Avatar of Speed
Starting at 14th level, while you aren't incapacitated, any ally within 30 feet of you who can see you can take the Dash action as a bonus action.

Order of the Awakened
Bonus Disciplines
At 1st level, you learn two additional psionic disciplines of your choice. They must be chosen from among the Awakened disciplines.

Awakened Talent
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, and Persuasion.

Psionic Investigation
Starting at 3rd level, if you hold an object and concentrate on it for 10 minutes, you learn a few basic facts about it. You gain a mental image from the object's point of view, showing the last creature to hold the object within the past 24 hours. You also learn of any events that have occurred within 20 feet of the object within the past hour. The events you perceive unfold from the object's perspective. You see and hear such events as if you were there, but can't use other senses.

Additionally, you can embed an intangible psionic sensor within the object. For the next 24 hours, you can use an action to learn the object's location relative to you and to look at the object's surroundings from its point of view as if you were there. This perception lasts until the start of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

Psionic Surge
Starting at 6th level, you can impose disadvantage on a target's saving throw against a discipline or talent you use, but at the cost of using your psychic focus. Your psychic focus immediately ends if it's active, and you can't use it until you finish a short or long rest. You can't use this feature if you can't use your psychic focus.

Spectral Form
At 14th level, as an action, you can transform into a ghostly version of yourself. While in this form, you have resistance to all damage, move at half speed, and can pass through objects and creatures while moving but can't willingly end your movement in their spaces. The form lasts for 10 minutes or until you use an action to end it. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

Order of the Immortal
Bonus Disciplines
At 1st level, you learn two additional psionic disciplines of your choice. They must be chosen from among the Immortal disciplines.

Immortal Durability
Starting at 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 per mystic level. In addition, while you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield, your base AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier.

Psionic Resilience
Starting at 3rd level, at the start of each of your turns after rolling initiative, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 0) if you have at least 1 hit point. These temporary hit points fade 10 minutes after you last made an attack.

Surge of Health
Starting at 6th level, as a reaction when you take damage, you can halve that damage against you. Your psychic focus immediately ends if it's active, and you can't use it until you finish a short or long rest. You can't use this feature if you can't use your psychic focus.

Immortal Will
Starting at 14th level, at the end of your turn while at 0 hit points, you can spend 5 psi points to immediately regain a number of hit points equal to your mystic level + your Constitution modifier.

Order of the Nomad
Bonus Disciplines
At 1st level, you learn two additional psionic disciplines of your choice. They must be chosen from among the Nomad disciplines.

Breadth of Knowledge
At 1st level, when you finish a long rest, you gain two proficiencies of your choice: two tools, two skills, or one of each. You can replace one or both of these selections with languages. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest.

Memory of One Thousand Steps
At 3rd level, as a reaction when you are hit by an attack, you can teleport to an unoccupied space that you occupied since the start of your last turn, and the attack misses you. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

Superior Teleportation
At 6th level, when you use a psionic discipline to teleport any distance, you can increase that distance by up to 10 feet.

Effortless Journey
Starting at 14th level, once on each of your turns, you can forfeit up to 30 feet of your movement to teleport the distance you forfeited. You must teleport to an unoccupied space you can see.

Order of the Soul Knife
Martial Training
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with medium armor and martial weapons.

Soul Knife
Starting at 1st level, as a bonus action, you create knives of energy that project from both of your fists. You can't hold anything in your hands while manifesting these blades. You can dismiss them as a bonus action. For you, a soul knife is a martial melee weapon with the light and finesse properties. It deals 1d8 psychic damage on a hit. As a bonus action, you can prepare to use the blades to parry; you gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn or until you are incapacitated.

Hone the Blade
Starting at 3rd level, you can spend psi points to augment your soul knife's attack rolls and damage. You gain a bonus to attack and damage rolls with your soul knives depending on the number of psi points spent, as shown on the table below. This bonus lasts for 10 minutes.

Psi Points	Damage and Attack
2	+1
5	+2
7	+4
Consumptive Knife
Starting at 6th level, whenever you slay an enemy creature with a soul knife attack, you immediately regain 2 psi points.

Phantom Knife
Starting at 14th level, as an action, you can make one attack with your soul knife. Treat the target's AC as 10 against this attack, regardless of the target's actual AC.

Order of the Wu Jen
Bonus Disciplines
At 1st level, you learn two additional psionic disciplines of your choice. They must be chosen from among the Wu Jen disciplines.

Hermit's Study
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Arcana, History, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Religion, or Survival.

Elemental Attunement
Starting at 3rd level, when a creature's resistance reduces the damage dealt by a psionic discipline of yours, you can spend 1 psi point to cause that use of the discipline to ignore the creature's resistance. You can't spend this point if doing so would increase the discipline's cost above your psi limit.

Arcane Dabbler
At 6th level, you learn three wizard spells of your choice and always have them prepared. The spells must be of 1st through 3rd level. As a bonus action, you can spend psi points to create spell slots that you can use to cast these spells, as well as other spells you are capable of casting. The psi point cost of each spell slot is detailed on the table below.

Spell Slot Level	Psi Cost
1st	2
2nd	3
3rd	5
4th	6
5th	7
The spell slot remains until you use it or finish a long rest. You must observe your psi limit when spending psi points to create a spell slot. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the chosen wizard spells with a different wizard spell of 1st through 3rd level.

Elemental Mastery
Starting at 14th level, if you have resistance to a type of damage, you can spend 2 psi points as a reaction when you take damage of that type to ignore that damage; you gain immunity to that damage type until the end of your next turn.

Psionic Disciplines and Talents
A mystic can learn any discipline regardless of its associated order.

Using a Discipline
Each psionic discipline has several ways you can use it. The discipline specifies the type of action and number of psi points it requires. It also details whether you must concentrate on its effects, how many targets it affects, what saving throws it requires, and so on.

Psychic Focus
The Psychic Focus section of a discipline describes the benefit you gain when you choose that discipline for your psychic focus.

Effect Options and Psi Points
A discipline provides different options for how to use it with your psi points. Each effect option has a name and the psi point cost of that option appears in parentheses. You must spend that number of psi points to use that option, while abiding by your psi limit. If you don't have enough psi points left, or the cost is above your psi limit, you can't use the option.

Some options show a range rather than a specific cost. To use that option, you must spend a number of points within that range, abiding by your psi limit. Some options let you spend additional psi points to increase a discipline's potency. Again, you must abide by your psi limit, and you must spend all the points when you first use the discipline. Each option notes specific information about its effect, including any action required to use it and its range.

Components
Disciplines don't require the components that many spells require. Using a discipline requires no spoken words, gestures, or materials.

Duration
An effect option in a discipline specifies how long its effect lasts.

Instantaneous: If no duration is specified, the effect of the option is instantaneous.

Concentration: Some options require concentration to maintain their effects. This requirement is noted with "conc.", and is followed by the maximum duration of the concentration.

Concentrating on a discipline follows the same rules as concentrating on a spell.

Targets and Areas of Effect
Psionic disciplines use the same rules as spells for determining targets and areas of effect.

Saving Throws and Attack Rolls
If a discipline requires a saving throw, it specifies the type of save and the results of a successful or failed saving throw. The DC is determined by your psionic ability. Some disciplines require you to make an attack roll to determine whether the discipline's effect hits its target. The attack roll uses your psionic ability.

Combining Psionic Effects
The effects of different psionic disciplines add together while the durations overlap. However, a specific option from a psionic discipline doesn't combine with itself if the option is used multiple times. Instead, the most potent effect applies while the durations of the effects overlap.

Psionics and spells are separate effects, and therefore their benefits and drawbacks overlap. A psionic effect that reproduces a spell is an exception to this rule.

Avatar Disciplines
Crown of Despair
Psychic Focus: While focused on this discipline, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

Crowned in Sorrow (1–7 psi): As an action, one creature you can see within 60 feet of you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d8 psychic damage per psi point spent, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.
Call to Inaction (2 psi; conc., 10 min.): If you spend 1 minute conversing with a creature, you can attempt to seed it with overwhelming ennui. At the end of the minute, you can use an action to force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed. On a failed save, it sits and is incapacitated until your concentration ends. This effect immediately ends if the target or any ally it can see is attacked or takes damage. On a successful save, the creature is unaffected and has no inkling of your attempt to bend its will.
Visions of Despair (3 psi): As an action, you force one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage, and its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. You can increase the damage by 1d6 per additional psi point spent on it.
Dolorous Mind (5 psi; conc., 1 min.): As an action, you choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. It must succeed on a Charisma saving throw, or it is incapacitated and has a speed of 0 until your concentration ends. It can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Crown of Disgust
Psychic Focus: While you are focused on this discipline, the area in a 5-foot radius around you is difficult terrain for any enemy that isn't immune to being frightened.

Eye of Horror (1–7 psi): As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d6 psychic damage per psi point spent and can't move closer to you until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.
Wall of Repulsion (3 psi; conc., 10 min.): As an action, you create an invisible, insubstantial wall of energy within 60 feet of you that is up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall lasts until your concentration ends. Any creature attempting to move through it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't move through the wall until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature can pass through it. A creature must make this save whenever it attempts to pass through the wall, whether willingly or unwillingly.
Visions of Disgust (5 psi; conc., 1 min.): As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 5d6 psychic damage, and until your concentration ends, it takes 1d6 psychic damage per creature within 5 feet of it at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the target takes only half the initial damage and suffers none of the other effects.
World of Horror (7 psi; conc., 1 min.): As an action, choose up to six creatures within 60 feet of you. Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 8d6 psychic damage, and it is frightened until your concentration ends. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage. While frightened by this effect, a target's speed is reduced to 0, and the target can use its action, and any bonus action it might have, only to make melee attacks. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Crown of Rage
Psychic Focus: While you are focused on this discipline, any enemy within 5 feet of you that makes a melee attack roll against creatures other than you does so with disadvantage.

Primal Fury (1–7 psi): As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage per psi point spent on this ability and immediately use its reaction to move its speed in a straight line toward its nearest enemy. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed.
Fighting Words (2 psi; conc., 10 min.): If you spend 1 minute conversing with a creature, you can use an action to force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw to resist feeling violent urges against one creature you describe to it or name. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed. On a failed save, the target attacks the chosen creature if it sees that creature before your concentration ends, using weapons or spells against a creature it was already hostile toward or unarmed strikes against an ally or a creature it was neutral toward. Once the fight starts, it continues to attack for 5 rounds before this effect ends. This effect immediately ends if the target or any ally it can see is attacked or takes damage from any creature other than the one it has been incited against. On a successful save, the creature is unaffected and has no inkling of your attempt to bend its will.
Mindless Courage (2 psi): As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or, until the end of your next turn, it can't willingly move unless its movement brings it closer to its nearest enemy that it can see. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed.
Punishing Fury (5 psi; conc., 1 min.): As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or, until your concentration ends, any creature within 5 feet of it can use a reaction to make a melee attack against it whenever the target makes a melee attack. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed.
Mantle of Command
Psychic Focus: While focused on this discipline, when you end your turn and didn't move during it, you can use your reaction to allow one ally you can see within 30 feet of you to move up to half their speed, following a path of your choice. To move in this way, the ally mustn't be incapacitated.

Coordinated Movement (2 psi): As a bonus action, choose up to five allies you can see within 60 feet of you. Each of those allies can use their reaction to move up to half their speed, following a path of your choice.
Commander's Sight (2 psi; conc., 1 rnd.): As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Until the start of your next turn, your allies have advantage on attack rolls against that target.
Command to Strike (3 psi): As an action, choose one ally you can see within 60 feet of you. That ally can use their reaction to immediately take the Attack action. You choose the targets.
Strategic Mind (5 psi; conc., 1 min.): As an action, you exert an aura of trust and command that unites your allies into a cohesive unit. Until your concentration ends, any ally within 60 feet of you on their turn can, as a bonus action, take the Dash or Disengage action or roll a d4 and add the number rolled to each attack roll they make that turn.
Overwhelming Attack (7 psi): As an action, choose up to five allies you can see within 60 feet of you. Each of those allies can use their reaction to take the Attack action. You choose the targets of the attacks.
Mantle of Courage
Psychic Focus: While focused on this discipline, you and allies within 10 feet of you who can see you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

Incite Courage (2 psi): As a bonus action, choose up to six creatures you can see within 60 feet of you. If any of those creatures is frightened, that condition ends on that creature.
Aura of Victory (1–7 psi; conc., 10 min.): As a bonus action, you project psionic energy until your concentration ends. The energy fortifies you and your allies when your enemies are felled; whenever an enemy you can see is reduced to 0 hit points, you and each of your allies within 30 feet of you gain temporary hit points equal to double the psi points spent to activate this effect.
Pillar of Confidence (6 psi; conc., 1 rnd.): As an action, you and up to five creatures you can see within 60 feet of you each gain one extra action to use on your individual turns. The action goes away if not used before the end of your next turn. The action can be used only to make one weapon attack or to take the Dash or Disengage action.
Mantle of Fear
Psychic Focus: While focused on this discipline, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

Incite Fear (2 psi; conc., 1 min.): As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until your concentration ends. Whenever the frightened target ends its turn in a location where it can't see you, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Unsettling Aura (3 psi; conc., 1 hr.): As a bonus action, until your concentration ends, any enemy within 60 feet of you that can see you must spend 1 extra foot of movement for every foot it moves toward you. A creature ignores this effect if immune to being frightened.
Incite Panic (5 psi; conc., 1 min.): As an action, choose up to eight creatures you can see within 90 feet of you that can see you. At the start of each of a target's turns before your concentration ends, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is frightened until the start of its next turn, and you roll a die. If you roll an odd number, the frightened target moves half its speed in a random direction and takes no action on that turn, other than to scream in terror. If you roll an even number, the frightened target makes one melee attack against a random target within its reach. If there is no such target, it moves half its speed in a random direction and takes no action on that turn. This effect ends on a target if it succeeds on three saving throws against it.
Mantle of Fury
Psychic Focus: While focused on this discipline in combat, you and any ally who starts their turn within 10 feet of you gains a 5-foot increase to their walking speed during that turn.
